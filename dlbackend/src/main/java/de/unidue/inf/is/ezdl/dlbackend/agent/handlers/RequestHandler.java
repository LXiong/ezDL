/**
 * A RequestHandler is an object that knows how to handle a request. A request
 * is a logical context that an agent is supposed to handle. An example for a
 * request is a search. The user sends a message to the search agent, signaling
 * that she wants documents for a query. The request is now the sequence of
 * actions necessary to generate an answer to the message. The document agent
 * might want to send a message to acknowledge the new search and then send
 * search message itself to a collection of wrappers. All these actions comprise
 * the request. Another request would be to ask the document agent for its
 * AgentLog. This request would be answered by just sending the log data.
 * <p>
 * The actions needed to handle a specific request are encapsulated in a
 * specific RequestHandler object. The implementor of RequestHandler only
 * contains methods and data that is needed to handle one specific request (e.g.
 * "give me the AgentLog") and all methods and data needed for that request are
 * in only one specific implementor of RequestHandler. This way we obey the DRY
 * principle.
 * <p>
 * RequestHandler implementors have to be annotated by {@link StartedBy} because
 * this is the only mechanism to invoke a RequestHandler.
