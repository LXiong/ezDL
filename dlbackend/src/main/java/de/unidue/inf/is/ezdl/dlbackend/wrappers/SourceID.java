/**
 * Class to identify the source of pieces of information.
 * <p>
 * The idea here is that some digital libraries only store certain parts of the
 * metadata of documents. DL 'A' might e.g. only store title, authors, year and
 * abstract while DL 'B' stores only title, authors, year and citation
 * information. So somewhere down the line (e.g. in the SearchAgent) these
 * pieces of information about a document is merged. Later, additional details
 * could be requested. Then, a wrapper might want to know where to find the
 * detail information about that document.
 * <p>
 * In this case, the RepositoryAgent would send a {@link DocumentDetailsFillAsk}
 * to the wrapper that basically says "please fill in the gaps" and the wrapper
 * can then take the source information from the document (see
 * {@link SourceInfo}) to find the details.
 * <p>
 * Now, maybe two different wrappers both wrap the same DL but using different
 * APIs. One might use a ToolkitAPI approach on the main user site of the DL
 * while the other uses a SOAP interface. In this case the information used to
 * retrieve the details might be different. So to distinguish between these two
 * different APIs, the {@link SourceID} also contains an identifier of the API.
