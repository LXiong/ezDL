/**
 * ConnectionThread is the class that deals with data exchange over a single
 * specific open socket. It answers any HTTP request that comes in with a dummy
 * answer. After that it keeps the connection open and deals with incoming
 * chunks and messages.
 * <p>
 * It uses two additional threads to deal with receiving and sending data
 * chunks. A chunk here is a string of data that belongs to a single message and
 * is separated somehow.
 * <p>
 * The re-occurring ping messages are sent in the wait loop of the
 * ConnectionThread itself and used for keeping the connection open in case HTTP
 * proxies are involved. Beware that keeping the connection over a proxy has not
 * been tested as of the time of writing of these lines.
