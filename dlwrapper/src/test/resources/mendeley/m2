{"abstract":"Imagine a world where you walk up to a computer and sing the gong fragment that has been plaguing you since breakfast.

You I confirm the computer's suggestion by listening to one of the many MP3 files it has found.","series":"Annual Review of Information Science and Technology","website":"http:\/\/www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de\/AFS\/Computermusik2003_04\/Vorlesung\/mir-overview.pdf","identifiers":{"isbn":"9783642116735"},"stats":{"readers":10,"discipline":[{"name":"Computer and Information Science","value":80},{"name":"Business Administration","value":10},{"name":"Social Sciences","value":10}],"country":[{"name":"Germany","value":30},{"name":"Spain","value":30},{"name":"Portugal","value":20}],"status":[{"name":"Student (Master)","value":20},{"name":"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)","value":20},{"name":"Student (Bachelor)","value":10}]},"issue":"Chapter 7","pages":"295-340","publication_outlet":"Annual Review of Information Science and Technology","type":"Journal Article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/music-information-retrieval\/","publisher":"Springer","uuid":"f3110250-6d00-11df-a2b2-0026b95e3eb7","authors":[{"forename":"J S","surname":"Downie"}],"title":"Music Information Retrieval","chapter":"7","volume":"37","year":2003,"categories":[102,101,99,454,63],"institution":"RMIT University"}
