AB  - A marginalization model for the multidimensional unfolding analysis of ranking data is presented. A subject samples one of a number of random points that are multivariate normally distributed. The subject perceives the distances from the point to all the stimulus points fixed in the same multidimensional space. The distances are error perturbed in this perception process. He/she produces a ranking dependent on these error-perturbed distances. The marginal probability of a ranking is obtained according to this ranking model and by integrating out the subject (ideal point) parameters, assuming the above distribution. One advantage of the model is that the individual differences are captured using the posterior probabilities of subject points. Three sets of ranking data are analyzed by the model.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(198805)39:3<147::AID-ASI1>3.3.CO;2-F In Part I of this study [2], it was found that full-text retrieval resulted in significantly higher recall and lower precision, compared with that of paragraphs, abstracts, and controlled vocabularies. In the present article (Part II of the study), document-term-weighting algorithms proposed in past research for automatic extractive indexing were examined as a means to improve the low precision of full-text retrieval. As a laboratory experiment, the precision of full-text retrieval enhanced by 29 algorithms was examined at the lowest, middle, and highest levels of recall, and compared with that of full-text retrieval without algorithms and to paragraph retrieval. The over-all effectiveness of seven representative algorithms was displayed and investigated in recall and precision graphs. Twenty-nine algorithms significantly improved the low precision of full-text retrieval, and 22 of 29 algorithms achieved higher precision than that of paragraph searching at the same level of recall, although these results were not statistically significant. However, there was no significant difference between algorithms, although the precision of the 29 algorithms varied considerably. The relative performance of algorithms seemed to depend on the search strategy employed and on the level of recall at which precision was measured. © 1988 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Identification, ranking and selecting hazardous traffic accident locations from a group under consideration is a funda- mental goal for traffic safety researchers. Few methods exist that can quantitatively, accurately and easily discriminate between sites that commonly have small and variable observation count periods. One method that embodies all these advantages is the hierarchical Bayesian model, the method proposed in this paper. The particular hierarchical Bayesian approach that we use incorporates expert knowledge about accident sites as a group believed a priori to be exchangeable, the Poisson assumption and a conjugate gamma prior. We then propose three natural strategies for ranking and selecting the most hazardous subgroup of accident locations. Also presented is an especially useful procedure that gives the probability that each particular site is worst and by how much it is worst. All proposed strategies are illustrated using previously published fatality accident data from 35 sites in Auckland, New Zealand

AB  - This paper uses state-level pollution data from 1986–1997 to construct two indices that rank U.S. states according to environmental outputs. A major finding is that marginal performers in other indices, such as Wyoming, garner top spots in these ranking systems. The paper also presents findings from fixed and random effects models of panel data that imply state income levels are positively associated with environmental outputs after a threshold level of income is obtained.

AB  - One probabilistic version of Coombs' unfolding model called the MMUR (Marginalization model for the Multidimensional Unfolding analysis of Ranking data) is extended to treat ranking data for groups. One favorable feature of the model is that it can both take into consideration individual differences without estimating the subject parameters and capture the differences between the groups in a systematic manner. Another advantage lies in the fact that one can see the group differences in the geometrical point configuration, since the model shows how the ideal points of the groups differ from each other in space. Four applications are provided which demonstrate that the model is useful for clarifying systematic differences in this type of data.

AB  - A method for the analysis, ranking and selection of R&D projects from a portfolio is outlined and demonstrated. It is proposed that an objective multi-criteria decision making method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), be used to split a portfolio of projects into accept, consider further and reject sub-groups. Next, the ‘consider further’ group is examined using a subjective method, the Value Creation Model. Such an approach allows for obvious decisions to be automated and complex decisions to be given careful consideration, an approach that is more consistent with how practising managers actually make select/reject decisions. DEA allows for comparison of variables without requiring weights or conversion factors. The relation between research strategy and consideration of categorical data is considered in relation to the research portfolio of the Advanced Technology Division of Bell Laboratories.

AB  - Abstract This paper aims to review the fiercely discussed question of whether the ranking of Wikipedia articles in search engines is justified by the quality of the articles. After an overview of current research on information quality in Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given. On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating Wikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the relevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results are unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the corresponding results position. Relevance judgments often roughly correspond with the results from the heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust in Wikipedia. One of the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the suggested criteria catalog, for instance, the different weighing of the supplied criteria, could serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works are applied to Wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search engine evaluation.

AB  - By using Theil's entropy measure, which is an additively decomposable measure of inequality, one may rank the various factors that affect occupational outcomes. Using the 5 percent sample of the 1990 U.S. Census, I find that sex and education have the greatest impact on occupational outcomes, followed by full-time work status. Age, race, and ever-married status have little impact on occupational outcomes.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.4630320309.abs Reports of journal titles ranked by use with space and cost information included for each title can provide a means for making certain objective journal collection development decisions. Each title can be assessed in relation to the others and the data for all titles can be cumulated so that decisions can be made at various cutoff points. Simple ranking of titles by raw use (RUR) may be inadequate and should be adjusted by some measure to allow for how much of the title is available to the user at the time of the collection of the use data. If the raw-use frequency of a title is divided by the actual linear shelf space of the title's file, a “density-of-use” frequency is obtained. If these frequencies are then ranked, a “density-of-use rank” (DUR) is formed. Some differences between RUR and DUR have been analyzed. Some evaluation of the quality of the differences has been made. There were significant changes in title ranking above random chance when an RUR was adjusted to become a DUR. At 80% of the total use of the entire collection, the number of titles in the DUR increased almost twofold over those in the RUR. Furthermore, less linear shelf space was used and the cost increase was not great. The number of potential unsatisfied title uses at two different cutoff levels in the rankings was less in the DUR.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/er.674.abs A deregulation of the electricity market in Europe will result in increased competition among the power-producing companies. They will therefore carefully estimate the financial risk in an investment in new power-producing capability. One part of the risk assessment is to perform a sensitivity analysis. This paper presents a sensitivity analysis using factorial design, resulting in an assessment of the most important technical and economical factors affecting an investment in a gas turbine combined cycle and a steam cycle fired by woodchips. The study is performed using a simulation model that optimizes the operation of existing power plants and potential new investments to fulfil the desired heat demand. The local utility system analysed is a Swedish district heating system with 655 GWh y−1 heat demand. The conclusion is that to understand which of the technical and economical factors affect the investment, it is not sufficient to investigate the parameters of the studied plant, but also the parameters related to the competing plants. Both the individual effects of the factors and the effect of their interaction should be investigated. For the energy system studied the price of natural gas, price of woodchips and investment cost have the major influence on the profitability of the investment.

He bases his analysis on the models of Bohn & Wolfe (1994) and Frey (2007a, b), of which parameters are estimated by minimizing a distance measure. He then uses the fitted models to calibrate confidence intervals and tests. He shows the validity of his approach through simulation and illustrates its application through the construction of distribution-free confidence intervals for the median area of apple tree leaves covered by a spray.
AB  - Inférence pour des données d'échantrillonnage en présence d'erreurs de classement L'auteur propose une approche inférentielle pour des données d'échantrillonnage en présence d'erreurs de classement. Il appuie son analyse sur les modèles de Bohn & Wolfe (1994) et de Frey (2007a, b), dont il estime les paramètres en minimisant une mesure de distance. Il se sert ensuite des modèles ajustés pour calibrer des intervalles de confiance et des tests. Il montre la validité de son approche à l'aide de simulations et en illustre l'application en construisant des intervalles de confiance non paramétriques pour la surface médiane des feuilles de pommier couvertes par un aérosol.

AB  - 1. Survival and reproduction in different habitats of a heterogeneous environment are affected by intrinsic habitat properties as well as by habitat-independent extrinsic factors. It is argued that the ranking of habitats according to quality may depend on extrinsic environmental factors that act with the same intensity in all habitats. This can happen if, across habitats, high reproductive success in the absence of extrinsic mortality is coupled with late reproduction. 2. In a model of a semelparous organism with overlapping generations that uses two habitats, the effect of different patterns of extrinsic mortality on habitat quality are analysed, as measured by the reproductive value of an egg, which estimates its expected contribution to the future gene pool. 3. Measurements of fitness components in Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) on four host species demonstrate that, across hosts, long development can be associated with high reproductive success in the absence of extrinsic mortality. As a result, the quality ranking of three out of the four hosts would be different in a stable population regulated by intraspecific competition and egg parasitoids than in a growing population or a stable population regulated by age-independent larval mortality. 4. It is suggested that habitat-independent mortality may play a role in the evolution of ecological niches.

Test specimens were aged in hot air by systematically varying the time and temperature from 24 to 96 h at 70 to 100°C. For an effective comparison the observed values were plotted as a function of time, temperature, and formulations. The data thus obtained were correlated with shelf-aging in particular cases, and it was observed that aging at 100°C for 24 h could be used for such formulations. A “sulfur donor” system cured nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) vulcanizate and an ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) vulcanizate showed the best retention of properties. Although the SEM micrograph of the NBR was in agreement with this observation, the EPDM was not. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 78: 2500–2510, 2000

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the facial profile preferences in a sample of 1,189 Asian teenagers (aged 15.3 ± 3.2 years). Five facial profile types were computer-generated by trained personnel (orthodontists and oral maxillofacial surgeons) to represent distinct facial types. Subjects were asked to rank the profiles in descending order of attractiveness. The ranking was as follows: orthognathic profile, bimaxillary retrusive profile, bimaxillary protrusive profile, mandibular retrognathic profile, and mandibular prognathic profile. The differences in rank scores between all the profile types were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Assessment of profile types among lay personnel could provide clinicians an indication into the relative attractiveness among profile types and health care workers in treatment prioritization among dysmorphic facial types.

A water-cooled probe and a small, thin, annular disk specimen heated by a radiator are used. Tests on AUC graphite and on a series of composites of transition-metal pseudobinary solid-solution carbides with graphite were very reproducible and reliable. A thermal-stress analysis for the graphite agreed well with the test results.

Experiments to determine the cause of this effect revealed that the social contact involved in the test was not responsible, but that rather the presence of the fish in a new environment (the test-aquarium) for 20 hours itself sufficed to restore the normal androgen concentrations. The blood corticoid levels of both high- and low-ranking males are also reduced to one third of initial levels by social isolation. The normal level of this hormone was, however, restored following a standard-opponent test only in the case of the high-ranking males; the corticoid levels of the low-ranking males remaining depressed. Transfer to a new environment in itself did not account for the effect on the high-ranking males. This result suggests that the pituitary-adrenal systems of high- and low-ranking males are differentially responsive to the social situation represented by the standard-opponent test.

The spatial model contains only one pathotype for simplicity. It is demonstrated numerically that it possesses a rate of disease increase p in common with spore pool mixture models which do not posses explicit spatial structure. This parameter is used to rank block mixture patterns of differing host genotype unit area. The variation in rate of disease increase with autodeposition is shown graphically for the chosen set of block geometries.

AB  - Irritant effects and disturbance of water-holding capacity induced by surfactants were investigated using the plastic occlusion stress test (POST) technique. 4 surfactants (sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), sorbitan monolaurate, cocoamidopropyl betaine and benzalkonium chloride) and an amphoteric/ nonionic (A/ N) mix were investigated. 1 × daily for 3 days, test surfactants were applied to marked sues (open) on the volar forearm. After 24 h occlusion with a plastic chamber on the 4th days. skin surface water loss (SSWL) (g/m2h) was recorded continuously for 25 min with an evaporimeter. The differences between the surfactants were statistically significant (Friedman's test p<0.01). SLS and the A/ N mix revealed significant differences compared to the other compounds (p<0.05), both in decay constants and in values recorded at the beginning and at the end of the decay curve. The study suggests a mechanism for the high irritant potential of sodium lauryl sulphate compared lo other surfactants: sorbitan monolaurate and benzalkonium chloride seem lo influence (at the concentrations tested) to a lesser extent the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum. The clinical and biological relevance of these observations requires long-term clinical correlations with final product use tests.

Synopsis
We propose that skin electrical current measurements can be used in vitro to effectively rank aqueous solutions containing surfactants and humectants (the enhancer) contacting the skin, relative to a PBS aqueous solution (the control) contacting the skin, based on their ability to perturb the skin aqueous pores. Specifically, we develop an in vitro ranking metric using the increase in the skin electrical current induced by an enhancer relative to the control. Aqueous contacting solutions containing (i) surfactants [SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate)] and C12E6 [dodecyl hexa (ethylene oxide)], (ii) humectants (glycerol and propylene glycol), and (iii) a control (PBS) were studied. Utilizing the new in vitro ranking metric, these aqueous contacting solutions were ranked as follows (from the mildest to the harshest): glycerol < propylene glycol < PBS < C12E6 < SDS. In order to further develop this ranking methodology, which can potentially lead to the reduction, or elimination, of costly and time-consuming procedures, such as human and animal testing and trial-and-error screening in vivo, it was important to correlate the findings of the in vitro ranking metric with direct in vivo skin barrier measurements. For this purpose, in vivo soap chamber measurements, including transepidermal water loss, visual skin dryness, and chromameter erythema measurements, were carried out on human volunteers using the aqueous surfactant–humectant solutions described above. The results of these in vivo measurements were found to be consistent with the ranking results obtained using the in vitro ranking metric. To further explore the validity of our model and to verify the skin barrier mitigating effect of glycerol, in vivo soap chamber measurements were carried out for aqueous SDS solutions containing 10 wt% added glycerol. These in vivo measurements support our recent in vitro finding that glycerol reduces the average radius and the pore number density of the skin aqueous pores, such that SDS micelles are hindered from penetrating into the skin and inducing skin barrier perturbation.
