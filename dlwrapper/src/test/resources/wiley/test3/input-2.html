AB  - Abstract 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(199908)50:2<111::AID-BIP1>3.3.CO;2-E With the objective of improving side-chain conformation prediction, we have analyzed the influence of various factors on prediction by the Self-Consistent Mean Field Theory method, applied to a set of high resolution x-ray protein structure models. These factors may be classed as variations in the mean field optimization protocol, variations in the potential energy function, and variations in rotamer library completeness. We have developed an optimization protocol that consistently reached lower mean field conformational free energies than two other protocols. This protocol led to an important improvement in prediction. We observed a major improvement in prediction with two more detailed van der Waals parameter sets, which we found to be due mainly to the introduction of scaling of 1–4 interactions. In a comparison of two knowledge-based rotamer libraries of considerably different size, we observed an unexpected decrease in prediction with an increase in library completeness. However, when we introduced a torsion potential term in the potential energy function, we found an important increase in average prediction and in the prediction of almost all residue types with a more complete rotamer set. The two knowledge-based rotamer libraries now became equivalent in terms of average prediction. The results we obtained in an analysis of the effect of the introduction of an additional electrostatic term in the potential energy function were largely inconclusive. However, we found a small increase in average prediction for an electrostatic potential term with a fixed dielectric constant of 15. The combined effect of all the factors we analyzed in this study resulted in average prediction accuracies of 79.9% for χ1, 68.1% for χ1+2, and 1.590 Å for global rms deviation (RMSD); the corresponding values for core residues were 88.2%, 78.6%, and 1.171 Å. These values represent improvements in average prediction of 6.5% for χ1, 9.1% for χ1+2, and 0.163 Å for global RMSD over the original conditions; the corresponding improvements in the core were 5.9%, 9.0%, and 0.180 Å, respectively. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.20336.abs The Open Video Digital Library (OVDL) provides digital video files to the education and research community and is distinguished by an innovative user interface that offers multiple kinds of visual surrogates to people searching for video content. The OVDL is used by several thousand people around the world each month and part of this success is due to its user interface. This article examines the interplay between research and practice in the development of this particular digital library with an eye toward lessons for all digital libraries. We argue that theoretical and research goals blur into practical goals and practical goals raise new research questions as research and development progress—this process is akin to walking along a Möbius strip in which a locally two-sided surface is actually part of a globally one-sided world. We consider the gulf between the theories that guide current digital library research and current practice in operational digital libraries, provide a developmental history of the OVDL and the research frameworks that drove its development, illustrate how user studies informed its implementation and revision, and conclude with reflections and recommendations on the interplay between research and practice.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/bip.360261207.abs One approach to finding the conformation of minimum energy for a complicated molecule is to perform energy minimization, perhaps coupled to more exhaustive search procedures such as dynamics or Monte Carlo sampling, from many starting conformation. Where there are geometric constraints on the conformations, as in a ring molecule, or a variable loop starting and ending in known constant regions of one of a series of homologous proteins, rapidly generating many such starting conformations, all satisfying the constraints, has been a problem in the past. We have devised an algorithm, which we call random tweak, which performs this task in the context of a torsional description of a molecule, and have used it to model the backbones of the six CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of the immunoglobulin MCPC603. These range in size from 5 to 19 residues, and have from 8 to 36 variable dihedral angles. Ensembles of 100 properly closed backbone structures for each CDR were generated under several conditions of van der Waals screening internally and against the rest of the molecule, and ensembles of 1000 were generated for selected CDRs. These structure “libraries” reveal how the geometry at the base of a CDR and the topography of the surrounding protein surface restrict the region of space that a given CDR can occupy. In accord with simple notions of chain molecule statistics, the more highly extended a CDR at its base, the more similar the possible structures and the fewer that are necessary to span the conformational space. Energy minimization and molecular dynamics studies (reported elsewhere) using these libraries to furnish starting conformations show that, as the number of residues in a CDR goes from five to nine, the number of randomly generated structures necessary to ensure that low-lying energetic minima, such as the native conformation, will be found several times goes from a few tens to a few hundred. Some of the spatial features of an ensemble of random conformations are implicit in the histogram of the rms atomic displacements calculated for all the pairs in the ensemble. The random tweak method is carried out by setting each dihederal angle on the main chain of the variable fragment to a random value, then using an iterated linearized Lagrange multiplier technique to enforce the geometric constraints with the minimal conformational perturbation. The time required for the algorithm is linear in fragment length, and the resulting ability of the method to handle large loops makes it especially applicable to the modeling of homologous proteins. In most cases, hundreds of acceptable structures could be generated in a few hours on a VAX 11/780. Where van der Waals screening against fixed atoms need not be performed, as for isolated ring molecules, generation times go down by an order of magnitude or more.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/jmr.533.abs A monoclonal IgM cryoglobulin with diverse binding behavior was isolated from a patient (Mez) with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. It gave very high titers in the binding of combinatorially synthesized libraries of peptides ranging in size from two to eight residues. The crystal structure of Mez Fv revealed that the binding site was divided into two cavities of unequal volumes with dimensions and chemical properties that were compatible with the binding of peptides. Access to this unique combination of structural information and peptide binding data led us to carry out Mez-peptide docking simulations to gain insight into the Mez binding propensities. In the present article, the results for docking of five peptide libraries are combined with discussions of the methods and approximations involved in the docking process. We analyze the origins of peptide binding affinity for Mez IgM in terms of its cross-reactivity and its structural preferences. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract 10.1110/ps.03250104.abs Accurate prediction of the placement and comformations of protein side chains given only the backbone trace has a wide range of uses in protein design, structure prediction, and functional analysis. Prediction has most often relied on discrete rotamer libraries so that rapid fitness of side-chain rotamers can be assessed against some scoring function. Scoring functions are generally based on experimental parameters from small-molecule studies or empirical parameters based on determined protein structures. Here, we describe the NCN algorithm for predicting the placement of side chains. A predominantly first-principles approach was taken to develop the potential energy function incorporating van der Waals and electrostatics based on the OPLS parameters, and a hydrogen bonding term. The only empirical knowledge used is the frequency of rotameric states from the PDB. The rotamer library includes nearly 50,000 rotamers, and is the most extensive discrete library used to date. Although the computational time tends to be longer than most other algorithms, the overall accuracy exceeds all algorithms in the literature when placing rotamers on an accurate backbone trace. Considering only the most buried residues, 80% of the total residues tested, the placement accuracy reaches 92% for χ1, and 83% for χ1 + 2, and an overall RMS deviation of 1 Å. Additionally, we show that if information is available to restrict χ1 to one rotamer well, then this algorithm can generate structures with an average RMS deviation of 1.0 Å for all heavy side-chains atoms and a corresponding overall χ1 + 2 accuracy of 85.0%.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.10102.abs The potential impact of the Internet on the public's demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance. The research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public's use of the library and its use of the Internet. The authors developed a consumer model of the American adult market for information services and resources, segmented by use (or nonuse) of the public library and by access (or lack of access) to, and use (or nonuse) of, the Internet. A national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments, and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the Internet. The analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments; describe why people are currently using the public library and the Internet; identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use; identify areas in which libraries and the Internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary; and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and/or the Internet. The data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the Internet is taking place, which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two. Longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices, which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development.

Through corroboratory evidence from usage statistics of Internet-based database services available through the digital library, responses to a statewide-administered library survey, and a Web-based survey of end users, the authors identify contributing factors for the organizational usability of state digital libraries. The authors refine and enhance an organizational usability model for the unique environment of state digital libraries and identify three modes of interaction (influence, communication, activity) and the challenges each interaction presents: in addressing diverse player needs and expectations; the unequal awareness and training in using state digital libraries; and the lack of sufficient communication channels among players. In addition, the findings highlight the double-edged impact of physical libraries on the state digital library.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/1097-0134(20000815)40:3<389::AID-PROT50>3.3.CO;2-U All published rotamer libraries contain some rotamers that exhibit impossible internal atomic overlaps if built in ideal geometry with all hydrogen atoms. Removal of uncertain residues (mainly those with B-factors ≥40 or van der Waals overlaps ≥0.4 Å) greatly improves the clustering of rotamer populations. Asn, Gln, or His side chains additionally benefit from flipping of their planar terminal groups when required by atomic overlaps or H-bonding. Sensitivity to skew and to the boundaries of χ angle bins is avoided by using modes rather than traditional mean values. Rotamer definitions are listed both as the modal values and in a preferred version that maximizes common atoms between related rotamers. The resulting library shows significant differences from previous ones, differences validated by considering the likelihood of systematic misfitting of models to electron density maps and by plotting changes in rotamer frequency with B-factor. Few rotamers now show atomic overlaps in ideal geometry; those overlaps are relatively small and can be understood in terms of bond angle distortions compensated by favorable interactions. The new library covers 94.5% of examples in the highest quality protein data with 153 rotamers and can make a significant contribution to improving the accuracy of new structures.

AB  - Abstract This work identifies changes in dominant topics in library and information science (LIS) over time, by analyzing the 3,121 doctoral dissertations completed between 1930 and 2009 at North American Library and Information Science programs. The authors utilize latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics diachronically and to identify representative dissertations of those topics. The findings indicate that the main topics in LIS have changed substantially from those in the initial period (1930–1969) to the present (2000–2009). However, some themes occurred in multiple periods, representing core areas of the field: library history occurred in the first two periods; citation analysis in the second and third periods; and information-seeking behavior in the fourth and last period. Two topics occurred in three of the five periods: information retrieval and information use. One of the notable changes in the topics was the diminishing use of the word library (and related terms). This has implications for the provision of doctoral education in LIS. This work is compared to other earlier analyses and provides validation for the use of LDA in topic analysis of a discipline.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/anie.199622881.abs Combinatorial synthesis has developed within a few years from a laboratory curiosity to a method that is taken seriously in drug research. Rapid progress in molecular biology and the resulting ability to determine the activity of new substances extremely efficiently have led to a change in paradigm for the synthesis of test compounds: in addition to the conventional procedure of synthesizing one substance after another, new methods allowing simultaneous creation of many structurally defined substances are becoming increasingly important. A characteristic of combinatorial synthesis is that a reaction is performed with many synthetic building blocks at once—in parallel or in a mixture— rather than with just one building block. All possible combinations are formed in each step, so that a large number of products, a so-called library, is obtained from only a few reactants. Several methods have been developed for combinatorial synthesis of small organic molecules, based on research into peptide library synthesis: single substances are produced by highly automated parallel syntheses, and special techniques enable targeted synthesis of mixtures with defined components. Many structures can be obtained by combinatorial synthesis, and the size of the libraries created ranges from a few individual compounds to many thousand substances in mixtures. This article gives an overview of the combinatorial syntheses of small organic molecules reported to date, performed both in solution and on a solid support. In addition, different techniques for identification of active compounds in mixtures are presented, together with ways to automate syntheses and process the large amounts of data produced. An overview of pionering companies active in this area is also given. The final outlook attempts to predict the future development of this exponentially growing area and the influence of this new thinking in other areas of chemistry.

AB  - Summary To determine whether metagenomic libraries sample adequately the dominant bacteria in aquatic environments, we examined the phylogenetic make-up of a large insert metagenomic library constructed with bacterial DNA from the Delaware River, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) library of 16S rRNA genes, and community structure determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The composition of the libraries and community structure determined by FISH differed for the major bacterial groups in the river, which included Actinobacteria, beta-proteobacteria and Cytophaga-like bacteria. Beta-proteobacteria were underrepresented in the metagenomic library compared with the PCR library and FISH, while Cytophaga-like bacteria were more abundant in the metagenomic library than in the PCR library and in the actual community according to FISH. The Delaware River libraries contained bacteria belonging to several widespread freshwater clusters, including clusters of Polynucleobacter necessarius, Rhodoferax sp. Bal47 and LD28 beta-proteobacteria, the ACK-m1 and STA2-30 clusters of Actinobacteria, and the PRD01a001B Cytophaga-like bacteria cluster. Coverage of bacteria with > 97% sequence identity was 65% and 50% for the metagenomic and PCR libraries respectively. Rarefaction analysis of replicate PCR libraries and of a library constructed with re-conditioned amplicons indicated that heteroduplex formation did not substantially impact the composition of the PCR library. This study suggests that although it may miss some bacterial groups, the metagenomic approach can sample other groups (e.g. Cytophaga-like bacteria) that are potentially underrepresented by other culture-independent approaches.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/ange.200300574.abs Hochdurchsatzsynthese und -screening von Verbindungsbibliotheken haben große Erwartungen für die Wirkstoffsuche geweckt. Für die Herstellung solcher Bibliotheken an der Festphase und in Lösung sind leistungsfähige Methoden entwickelt worden. Die Synthesestrategie wird schon lange nicht mehr nach allgemeinen Erwägungen ausgewählt, sondern mit Blick auf die spezielle Fragestellung. In diesem Aufsatz beschreiben wir Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Methoden, die bei der Entwicklung neuer Programme helfen sollen. Als Beispiel beschreiben wir unsere Versuche, mithilfe von Lösungstechniken Modulatoren für zelluläre Signale durch Beeinflussung von Protein-Protein- oder Protein-DNA-Wechselwirkungen zu identifizieren. Das Vorurteil, niedermolekulare Substanzen seien für therapeutische Intervention an solchen Zielstrukturen ungeeignet, konnten wir beim Screening unserer Bibliotheken gegen eine repräsentative Auswahl extrazellulärer und intrazellulärer Targets widerlegen: Mithilfe zahlreicher Testmethoden identifizierten wir die ersten niedermolekularen Modulatoren für Protein-Protein-Wechselwirkungen und erarbeiteten ein allgemeines Verfahren für derartige Untersuchungen.

AB  - Abstract Aim:  To present an overview of the concepts of marketing and to examine ways in which they can be applied to health libraries. Methods:  A review was carried out of literature relating to health libraries using lisa, cinahl, bni and Google. Results:  Marketing is seen as a strategic management activity aimed at developing customer relationships. Concepts such as the ‘four Ps’ (product, price, place and promotion), marketing plans, the marketing mix, segmentation, promotion and evaluation are identified and discussed in relation to health libraries. Conclusion:  In increasingly complex health service and information environments, the marketing and promotion of library services is becoming more important if those services are to justify the resources given to them. Marketing techniques are equally applicable to physical and digital library services.

AB  - Abstract Objective:  An updated systematic review was carried out of research studies looking at the value and impact of library services on health outcomes for patients and time saved by health professionals. Methods:  A comprehensive systematic search was undertaken of the published literature to September 2003 in eric, lisa, medline, premedline, embase, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Google. Some handsearching was carried out, reference lists were scanned and experts in the field were contacted. Twenty-eight research studies of professionally led libraries for health-care staff, including clinical librarian projects, met the inclusion criterion of at least one health or ‘time saved’ outcome. Papers were critically appraised using internationally accepted criteria. Data were extracted and results were summarised using a narrative format as the studies were heterogeneous and precluded a statistical analysis. Results:  There is evidence of impact from both traditional and clinical librarian services. The higher quality studies of traditional services measured impacts of 37–97% on general patient care, 10–31% on diagnosis, 20–51% on choice of tests, 27–45% on choice of therapy and 10–19% on reduced length of stay. Four studies of clinical librarian projects suggested that professionals saved time as a result of clinical librarian input, and two of these studies showed evidence of cost-effectiveness. However, the clinical librarian studies were generally smaller, with poorer quality standards. Conclusions:  Research studies suggest that professionally led library services have an impact on health outcomes for patients and may lead to time savings for health-care professionals. The available studies vary greatly in quality but the better quality studies also suggest positive impacts. Good practice can be gathered from these studies to guide the development of a pragmatic survey for library services that includes the direct effects for patients among the outcome measures.

An eight-variable model for classifying journal-ranking studies is outlined. A review of LIS journal rankings of the last half-century identifies 178 published between 1952 and 1997. The majority of these used some type of citation measure, followed by rankings based on production, subjective judgment, and reading, respectively. Analysis of JASIS's, and its immediate predecessor, American Documentation's, position in these rankings, found that they were logically excluded from 18. In the remaining 160, they ranked first in 20 and in the top five in 88. It is noted that JASIS also appears on many lists of “core” LIS journals, and that it has been the object of investigation in numerous studies.

Constant dollar spending on research is compared with constant dollar spending on libraries 1960–1995. Price's exponential growth constant is compared with constant dollars spent on academic research and on libraries. An evaluation of the indirect cost policy by which library costs are reimbursed as a function of science grant management suggests that it has failed to promote cost-effective research. An evaluation of the impact of various information technologies finds enhancements to dissemination but misconceptions of their potential for savings.

KW  - DNA LibraryA collection or bank of DNA clones generated from DNA of an organism that is either stored in bulk or in array in microplates. The relationship between the clones can be established by sequencing, by restriction mapping and/or by cross-hybridization
KW  - Complementary DNA Library (cDNA Library)A collection of clones of cDNA synthesized from RNAs present in a cell or an organism by reverse transcription in vitro using an enzyme named reverse transcriptase. In general, cDNA libraries are constructed from messenger (m) RNA
KW  - Expression LibraryA library of DNA clones that are created in an expression vector in order that the genes present in the library can be directly expressed in their host cells
KW  - Genomic DNA LibraryA collection of clones made from a set of DNA fragments representing the entire genome of an organism. The fragments can be generated either by partial digestion of source DNA with one or more restriction enzymes, or by physical shearing followed by fragment-end repair. Small-insert genomic DNA libraries are traditionally referred to as those cloned in the plasmid, phage, cosmid, or fosmid vectors, with an average insert size of up to 45 kbp. However, recent studies have shown that the plasmid, cosmid, and fosmid vectors are also capable of cloning and stably maintaining DNA fragments of greater than 300 kbp. The clones of small-insert genomic DNA libraries are often stored in bulk, and thus the libraries are unordered libraries. Large-insert genomic DNA libraries include those cloned in the bacteriophage P1 (P1), bacteriophage P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), plant-transformation-competent binary BAC (BIBAC), plasmid-based clone (PBC) and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors, with an average insert size of 100 kb or greater. The clones of large-insert genomic DNA libraries are often arrayed in 96- or 384-well microplates, and thus the libraries are ordered libraries
KW  - Bacteriophage λA phage that infects bacteria such as Escherichia coli. It has a complex set of regulatory mechanisms to determine whether it will lysogenize or lyze the host bacteria. The bacteriophage lysogenizes if it quietly inserts its DNA into the bacterial genome to become dormant and to be reproduced whenever the host bacterium reproduces. The bacteriophage lyzes the host cell if it hijacks the bacterium's cellular machinery to reproduce itself in order to infect more bacteria, causing the host bacterium to self-destruct shortly after infection. Bacteriophage λ is widely used as a cloning vector for genomic DNA and cDNA library construction
KW  - PlasmidA small circular genetic element that is stably inherited independent of the chromosome(s) of the host cell. Plasmids have been found in bacteria and fungi. They are widely used as cloning vectors to introduce foreign DNA into both bacterial and yeast cells and for genomic DNA and cDNA library construction
KW  - CosmidArtificially constructed plasmid-based cloning vector containing the cos sequence of phage-λ. Therefore, cosmids can be packaged in the phage particles for infection into E. coli, permitting cloning of DNA fragments of up to 45 kbp in bacterial hosts
KW  - Cloning VectorA DNA molecule originating from a virus, a plasmid, or the cell of a higher organism into which a foreign DNA fragment of appropriate size can be integrated without loss of the vector's capacity for self-replication; vectors are used to introduce foreign DNA into host cells where it can be reproduced in a large quantity. Examples are plasmids, cosmids, BACs, PACs, BIBACs, PBCs, and YACs; vectors are often recombinant molecules containing DNA sequences from several sources. In general, a desirable DNA cloning vector should contain elements essential for DNA replication, multiple cloning sites, and selection for both transformants and recombinants (the clones containing inserts)

AB  - DNA libraries have been invaluable tools for molecular biology research. They have facilitated the study of the genes and genomes of complex organisms by providing a method of producing large amounts of easily manipulated DNA for the investigation of any region of interest from the cloned DNA representative of the entire genome. A DNA library is a collection of DNA clones constructed in vitro by inserting the fragments of source DNA into a cloning vehicle or vector, which contains all elements required for the delivery of the foreign DNA fragments and stable propagation as a plasmid, a bacteriophage or an artificial chromosome in the host cells. Depending on their DNA source, DNA libraries can be categorized as cDNA libraries, genomic DNA libraries, and oligo libraries. The genomic DNA libraries could further be classified into plasmid, phage, cosmid, P1, BAC, PAC, BIBAC, PBC, and YAC libraries, according to the cloning vectors used. Genomic DNA libraries could be constructed with insert sizes from several up to a million base pairs (bp), depending on research purposes and cloning technologies. Many strategies and techniques have been developed and used for construction of DNA libraries from plants, animals, insects and microbes. DNA libraries are essential resources and tools for all research areas of molecular cell biology and molecular medicine, from gene discovery, cloning, and characterization to gene therapy.

AB  - The field of combinatorial peptide chemistry was created when the first limited peptide library was synthesized with multipin technology in 1984. Since 1990, the field of combinatorial chemistry has advanced rapidly. It has emerged as a powerful tool in the study of many biological systems. In essence, a combinatorial peptide library (numbering 104–108 different molecules) is chemically synthesized and subjected to screening for biological activity. Such screening allows for the rapid discovery of peptide ligands with biological interest. The amino acid sequence of an “active” peptide is then determined. Other biologic peptide libraries, such as those involving filamentous phage-display peptides, can typically accommodate only the 20 natural amino acids. In contrast, synthetic peptide libraries have the potential to incorporate D-amino acids and other unnatural amino acids, as well as specific secondary structures or scaffolding structures that may enhance biologic activity. In addition to amino acids, biological subunits such as monosaccharides, nucleotides, lipids, or even small organic moieties can be used. The advent of these peptide, nonpeptide oligomer, or small molecule library methods not only facilitates the drug discovery process but also provides important information for the fundamental understanding of molecular recognition.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.10342.abs This study presents a test of the Anxiety-Expectation Mediation (AEM) model of library anxiety. The AEM model contains variables that are directly or indirectly related to information search performance, as measured by students' scores on their research proposals. This model posits that library anxiety and self-perception serve as factors that mediate the relationship between performance in writing a research proposal and other cognitive, personality, and demographic variables. The model was tested using 225 graduate students enrolled in several sections of an introductory-level course at a midsouthern university. Structural equation modeling techniques supported the AEM model. In particular, library anxiety and research achievement were reciprocally related. Furthermore, library anxiety mediated the relationship between research performance and the following variables: age, grade point average, learning style, academic procrastination, and self-perception. The path analysis also revealed a direct, positive path from self-perception to research performance. In addition, self-perception moderated the relationship between research achievement and academic procrastination, perfectionism, and hope. The AEM model of library anxiety suggests that Wine's (1980) Cognitive-Attentional-Interference theory, Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, and Bostick's (in press) ILP model of library anxiety, and Bandura's (1977) self-efficacy theory can be applied to the library and information context. Findings are discussed within the framework of current social-psychological models of educational achievement.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.20198.abs A questionnaire was distributed to local union officials in Illinois in order to determine the officials' use of various types of libraries, their satisfaction with their experience in using the libraries, the problems they encountered in library use, and their opinion of various ways in which libraries might be made more useful to them. They were also asked whether they had had training in how to find information. Respondents to the survey used more than one type of library, and their union role had an impact on which type they were likely to use. They used different types of libraries to find different types of information. In general they were satisfied with their library experience, but they found library collections inadequate for their needs. Respondents who had had training in how to find information appeared to use libraries more but differed little in the frequency or types of problems encountered from those who had no training. When asked their opinion on various suggestions for improving library service to local union officials, they preferred measures that gave greater emphasis to increasing labor materials in library collections. The findings of this study, combined with those of our earlier study (Chaplan & Hertenstein, 2002), suggest that an information seeking model developed by Wilkinson (2001) may be useful in explaining union officials' information seeking behavior.

The response rate was over 74%. Results show that 25 (30%) libraries have PSGs dedicated to Web usability. Seventy-one (85%) libraries have conducted usability testing on their main Web sites, online public access catalogs (OPAC), or lower-level pages. Nevertheless, only seven libraries performed iterative testing of these platforms at pre-, during, and post-design stages. Statistical analysis indicates that having PSGs does not affect the amount of usability testing performed or the resources available for library Web usability initiatives. In addition, ARL ranking has no or little impact on PSGs, testing, or resources.

AB  - Abstract This article focuses on the collaboration between the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM) libraries and the Welsh National Health Service (NHS) libraries to create a joint library catalogue. The goal was to create an all-Wales resource that gave users one access point to search for the location and availability of health-related material in any Welsh medical library. This venture grew out of the existing collaborative scheme, the All-Wales Health Information and Library Extension Services (AWHILES). Currently, all seven UWCM libraries and 17 NHS libraries contribute to the catalogue. Four more libraries are due to join in late 2003 or early 2004. All UWCM and AWHILES libraries would then be contributing members of the joint catalogue. The article discusses the background and motivation to the creation of the database. It explores the positives and negatives of the project plus what was learnt as the venture progressed. It reviews the establishment and operations of the Welsh Health Voyager User Group (WHVUG) created to involve all contributing members in the running and future development of the library catalogue.

AB  - This chapter discusses molecular similarity and diversity concepts and methods and their main applications to combinatorial library design, the selection of compound subsets, and ligand-based “virtual screening.” Relevant medicinal chemistry applications discussed include the design of “diverse,” “representative,” and “thematic/focused/biased” libraries and subsets. The latter application is of particular relevance, in that there is a recent trend to approach drug discovery by a “target class” or “gene family” approach, such as 7-TM G-protein-coupled receptors.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.4630340303.abs This article analyzes the prospects for costs of computerized operation of libraries relative to costs of more conventional operation. Conventional library operation is labor intensive and not readily amenable to cumulative increases in labor productivity. This helps to explain the rapid and cumulative rise in cost per volume and/or student served relative to the rise in the economy's price level during the earlier postwar period. Because the price of computer hardware has been falling at a spectacular rate, it has been expected that computerized operation of libraries would become increasingly inexpensive relative to conventional procedures. Yet the evidence indicates that such a differential has not materialized. It is shown why the costs of computerized operation should in fact not be expected to fall along with the price of computer hardware. The reason is that the very decline in computer hardware prices has increased the share of software and other labor-intensive activities in the total budget of computer operation. The implications of this relationship for library operations are analyzed.

To provide a comprehensive bibliography of library value and impact studies. Methods:  Literature review and background based on personal involvement in the studies under discussion. Results:  The author's studies demonstrate an ongoing evolution of value and impact studies since the mid-1970s. In health sciences libraries, the approach taken to measuring value and impact has been strongly influenced by the type of research being conducted in the health sciences field as a whole. As a result, health sciences library researchers have become early adopters of methods that incorporate outcome and impact measures and rigorous research designs, and the concept of evidence-based library and information practice. The paper recommends that a range of research approaches from various disciplines be used to guide future evaluation research. Conclusions:  Value and impact studies will continue to be important resources for evidence-based practice as health information professionals deal with evolving user needs and new ways of delivering information to a variety of audiences.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.20510.abs A user's understanding of the libraries they work in, and hence of what they can do in those libraries, is encapsulated in their “mental models” of those libraries. In this article, we present a focused case study of users' mental models of traditional and digital libraries based on observations and interviews with eight participants. It was found that a poor understanding of access restrictions led to risk-averse behavior, whereas a poor understanding of search algorithms and relevance ranking resulted in trial-and-error behavior. This highlights the importance of rich feedback in helping users to construct useful mental models. Although the use of concrete analogies for digital libraries was not widespread, participants used their knowledge of Internet search engines to infer how searching might work in digital libraries. Indeed, most participants did not clearly distinguish between different kinds of digital resource, viewing the electronic library catalogue, abstracting services, digital libraries, and Internet search engines as variants on a theme.

AB  - Abstract A survey of 4,032 youth in grades 5 through 12 was conducted to determine the impact youth's use of the Internet was having on their use of the public library. Results indicated that 100% of the youth had access to the Internet from one or more locations, and that although one quarter of the youth accessed the Internet at the public library, the public library was the least frequently used source of Internet access. For youth without Internet access at home, the public library was also the least used alternate source of access. Approximately 69% of the youth reported that they had visited a public library during the school year. Having Internet access at home did not affect whether or not youth visited the library however, Internet access at home appears to have affected the frequency with which youth visit the library. Youth without Internet access at home visited the library more frequently, whereas youth with Internet access at home visited the library less frequently. Use of the Internet also appeared to have diminished youth's need to use the public library as a source of personal information however, use of the Internet appeared not to have affected their use of the public library for school work or for recreation. Among youth, use of both the Internet and the public library appear to be complementary activities.

A broad definition of user interface is employed which includes data structures, in addition to searching and indexing software. The following features of online public access catalogs are discussed: the demonstration of relationships between records, the provision of entry vocabularies, the arrangement of multiple entries on the screen, the provision of access points, the display of single records, and the division of the catalog into separate files or indexes. For each feature user studies and other research on line public access catalogs are reviewed and those findings summarized which provide insight into user needs concerning that particular feature; issues are identified and directions for further research are suggested. Implications for cataloging codes and standards and system design are discussed. © 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This literature review covers a wide range of publications (articles, books, reports and government publications) that provide an overview of the wider topic of partnership working. It is not a systematic review, but the authors’ personal review, drawing largely on the resources available in the King's Fund Library. Partnership working is a key component of the UK government's modernization agenda, particularly in the health field. However, the principles of achieving successful partnership are generally applicable. The review therefore concentrates on literature that can provide guidance for people planning to set up a partnership, or re-evaluating an existing partnership. The sections of this review comprise: definition of partnership working; types of partnership; partnership initiatives; drivers; critical success factors; barriers; benefits; the process of partnership working; evaluation and assessment tools; demolishing the Berlin Wall: government policy on partnership working; exemplars of library information service partnerships.

Applying Putnam's social capital theory, we examine how social capital in three New York City neighbourhoods affects usage of local branch libraries. A survey was conducted to understand differences in public library use and social capital in the neighbourhoods. Diversity and segregation indices were included as additional measures of social capital. The study found that neighbourhoods with higher levels of social capital, especially bridging social capital, tend to have higher public library use.

AB  - Phage display has been extensively used to study protein-protein interactions, receptor- and antibody-binding sites, and immune responses, to modify protein properties, and to select antibodies against a wide range of different antigens. In the format most often used, a polypeptide is displayed on the surface of a filamentous phage by genetic fusion to one of the coat proteins, creating a chimeric coat protein, and coupling phenotype (the protein) to genotype (the gene within). As the gene encoding the chimeric coat protein is packaged within the phage, selection of the phage on the basis of the binding properties of the polypeptide displayed on the surface simultaneously results in the isolation of the gene encoding the polypeptide. This unit describes the background to the technique, and illustrates how it has been applied to a number of different problems, each of which has its neurobiological counterparts. Although this overview concentrates on the use of filamentous phage, which is the most popular platform, other systems are also described. Curr. Protoc.

AB  - Information professionals use the Internet in two broad areas of library management: library resources and library functions. The applications of the Internet in the management of library resources include the identification, selection, acquisition, organization, access, utilization, and evaluation of information. Applications in the management of library functions include planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, reporting, and budget. Areas of future focus relate to collections, users, technology, information providers, and education of information professionals. The role of the librarian in facilitating the connection of users with information includes some of the following priorities: equity of access, protection of intellectual content, understanding diverse users, preservation, and emerging technology. These priorities and other traditional values of the profession will continue to be important. The opportunities for the application of the Internet for library management are enormous.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.21308.abs University libraries invest a massive amount of resources in digitizing information for the Web, yet there is growing concern that much of this information is being underutilized. The present study uses the technology acceptance model (TAM) to investigate university library website resources (ULWR) usage. We categorize users based on academic roles and then analyze them as subgroups in order to observe different adoption patterns across groups. A total of 299 usable responses was collected from four different universities and across three populations: undergraduate, master, and doctoral student/faculty groups. The findings show that different library users indeed access ULWR for different reasons, resulting in a need for tailored managerial efforts. Overall, the extended TAM explains undergraduate students' usage best; the explanatory power of the model is significantly lower for the doctoral student/faculty group. Some of the findings challenge results reported in TAM research in other fields. The unexpected findings may result from the application of the model to a different context. Detailed theoretical implications and managerial guidance are offered.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.21072.abs Libraries, private and public, offer valuable resources to library patrons. As of today, the only way to locate information archived exclusively in libraries is through their catalogs. Library patrons, however, often find it difficult to formulate a proper query, which requires using specific keywords assigned to different fields of desired library catalog records, to obtain relevant results. These improperly formulated queries often yield irrelevant results or no results at all. This negative experience in dealing with existing library systems turns library patrons away from directly querying library catalogs; instead, they rely on Web search engines to perform their searches first, and upon obtaining the initial information (e.g., titles, subject headings, or authors) on the desired library materials, they query library catalogs. This searching strategy is an evidence of failure of today's library systems. In solving this problem, we propose an enhanced library system, which allows partial, similarity matching of (a) tags defined by ordinary users at a folksonomy site that describe the content of books and (b) unrestricted keywords specified by an ordinary library patron in a query to search for relevant library catalog records. The proposed library system allows patrons posting a query Q using commonly used words and ranks the retrieved results according to their degrees of resemblance with Q while maintaining the query processing time comparable with that achieved by current library search engines.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:  To carry out a usability evaluation of the recently launched South London and Maudsley NHS Trust library website. Methods:  A variety of standard methodologies were employed: content and design evaluation of selected comparable sites, focus groups, a questionnaire survey of library and Web development staff, heuristic evaluation, observation testing, card sorting/cluster analysis, and label intuitiveness/category membership testing. All test participants were staff of or providers of services to the trust. Demographic information was recorded for each participant. Results:  Test participants’ overall responses to the site were enthusiastic and favourable, indicating the scope and content of the site to be broadly appropriate to the user group. Testers made numerous suggestions for new content. Usability problems were discovered in two main areas: in the organization of the site, and in the terminology used to refer to information services and sources. Based on test results, proposals for a revised menu structure, improved accessibility, and changes to the terminology used within the site are presented. Conclusion:  Usability evaluation methods, appropriately scaled, can be advantageously applied to NHS library websites by an individual Web editor working alone.

This article describes principal programs and activities of the National Library of Medicine and their effects on health sciences libraries: the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (MEDLARS), implementation of the Medical Library Assistance Act (MLAA), and defense of “fair use” of copyrighted material. The article briefly summarizes more recent Federal activities which directly affect access to and dissemination of health information and concludes with a summary of problems for which solutions must be found if health sciences libraries are to be prepared to meet the future. It is clear from comparing the programs described with current government attitudes that, although the Federal government has promoted advancement in the dissemination of biomedical information in the past, this trend is reversing, and Federal funding to libraries is decreasing while the cost of accessing information is increasing. © 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT:  Equity in the delivery of urban services traditionally has been evaluated by considering the quantities of the service provided to residents of different neighborhoods within the city. For services provided at specific locations, such as branch libraries, such an approach fails to incorporate the importance of travel to the facilities and the value placed on accessibility to them. This study examines service provision by 21 branch libraries in Indianapolis using input and output measures. The study evaluates the quantities of library services provided as well as the accessibility of neighborhood residents to them. The findings show clear tradeoffs between quantity and accessibility with different packages of benefits to residents in different parts of the city.

AB  - Peptide libraries, which consist of a few thousands to tens of millions of distinct peptides, can be generated combinatorially through biologic or synthetic approaches. The phage-display peptide library method is simple and economical, and peptides with various natural protein folds can be generated by this approach; but this biologic method generally is limited to peptides that contain only L-amino acids. Synthetic combinatorial libraries, however, can accommodate D-amino acids, unnatural amino acids, and even organic moieties, which makes these approaches highly versatile. These synthetic methods include the spatially addressable parallel library method, the combinatorial library method that requires deconvolution, the one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library method, the self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) encoded chemical microarrays, and the synthetic library method that requires chromatography selection. Various methods to screen these combinatorial libraries have been developed. For example, phage-display peptide libraries can be screened for the ability of phages to bind to unique immobilized target proteins or whole cells, peptide microarrays can be screened for their ability to interact with fluorescent proteins, combinatorial library methods that require deconvolution can be screened by standard solution-phase assays, and OBOC libraries can be screened by on-bead binding or functional assays or several solution-phase cell-based or biochemical assays. Combinatorial peptide library methods are enabling technologies that have proven to be very useful in basic research and drug discovery.

* This study examines librarians' attitudes toward the marketing of library services, as libraries continue their transition to a marketing orientation. Although prior studies had observed misunderstandings and hostility to marketing among librarians, most previous discussions of this topic were either speculative or based on extremely small samples. In order to provide more evidence in this matter, a large-scale survey of members of the New Jersey Library Association (NJLA) was conducted. A ‘Pro Marketing’ scale was introduced and used to segment participants with respect to their attitudes. The findings indicate that most respondents expressed relatively positive attitudes toward marketing, but that more positive attitudes were expressed by public librarians than school or college/university librarians, and by administrators as opposed to reference and technical services librarians. Illustrative respondent comments and implications for library management are included. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A state-of-the-art review, and a survey of academics in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States covered the following themes: origins of professional articles; state of the printed journal; electronic publishing—pioneering research and development; publishing via commercial database hosts; publishing via the Internet and related academic networks; publishing via portable electronic media; tensions in document supply and interlending; academics as authors and readers of professional articles, and universities as publishers. Responses of 582 academics in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to a survey in the second half of 1992 enabled an assessment of the position of academics in relation to electronic publishing. Evidence was interpreted through two complementary theoretical perspectives which allowed electronic publishing to be viewed (a) as a process of technologically induced structural change across an industry, and (b) as a means of increasing efficiency and gaining competitive advantage. It was concluded that the contribution of electronic publishing lies in greater diversity and choice in a marketplace where at-source-subsidized publishing competes with fee-for-service publishing. Recommendations are made for new relationships among academics, publishers, libraries, and universities. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

To understand different aspects of researchers' information-seeking behavior, this article surveyed 2,063 academic researchers in natural science, engineering, and medical science from five research universities in the United States. A Web-based, in-depth questionnaire was designed to quantify researchers' information searching, information use, and information storage behaviors. Descriptive statistics are reported. Additionally, analysis of results is broken out by institutions to compare differences among universities. Significant findings are reported, with the biggest changes because of increased utilization of electronic methods for searching, sharing, and storing scholarly content, as well as for utilizing library services. Generally speaking, researchers in the five universities had similar information-seeking behavior, with small differences because of varying academic unit structures and myriad library services provided at the individual institutions.

Through a presentation of the history of library evaluation, a measurement matrix is developed that demonstrates the relationship between the topics and perspectives of measurement. These measurements are then combined through evaluation criteria, and then different participants in the library system view those criteria for decision-making. By implementing this framework for holistic measurement and cumulative evaluation, library evaluators can gain a more holistic knowledge of the library system and library administrators can be better informed for their decision-making processes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Stellar population models of absorption-line indices are an important tool for the analysis of stellar population spectra. They are most accurately modelled through empirical calibrations of absorption-line indices with the stellar parameters such as effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity, which are the so-called fitting functions. Here we present new empirical fitting functions for the 25 optical Lick absorption-line indices based on the new stellar library Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra (MILES). The major improvements with respect to the Lick/IDS library are the better sampling of stellar parameter space, a generally higher signal-to-noise ratio and a careful flux calibration. In fact, we find that errors on individual index measurements in MILES are considerably smaller than in Lick/IDS. Instead, we find the rms of the residuals between the final fitting functions and the data to be dominated by errors in the stellar parameters. We provide fitting functions for both Lick/IDS and MILES spectral resolutions and compare our results with other fitting functions in the literature. A fortran 90 code is available online in order to simplify the implementation in stellar population models. We further calculate the offsets in index measurements between the Lick/IDS system to a flux-calibrated system. For this purpose, we use the three libraries MILES, ELODIE and STELIB. We find that offsets are negligible in some cases, most notably for the widely used indices Hβ, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335. In a number of cases, however, the difference between the flux-calibrated library and Lick/IDS is significant with the offsets depending on index strengths. Interestingly, there is no general agreement between the three libraries for a large number of indices, which hampers the derivation of a universal offset between the Lick/IDS and flux-calibrated systems.

Following this, they were asked to write a short narrative of one of these experiences. Incidents reported by participants ranged from preschool to college age, and content analysis indicated that a majority took place at two or more grade levels, sometimes as early as the participant's first (preschool) visit to a library. Phenomenological analysis of individual narratives produced a thematic structure for each of the four grade levels represented in the data: elementary school and younger, middle school, high school, and college/adult. Themes common across all four levels include Atmosphere, Size and Abundance, Organization/Rules and Their Effects on Me, and What I Do in the Library. A theme of Memories was unique to narratives that took place during elementary and younger age levels. Although all remaining themes were noted across age levels, the relative importance of various themes and subthemes was different at different ages. Implications of the thematic structure for library practice are discussed.

Part 1 focuses on approaches to evaluation that have been proposed for mainstream digital information services. This paper investigates evaluative models developed for some innovative digital library projects, and some major national and international electronic health information projects. The value of ethnographic methods to provide qualitative data to explore outcomes, adding to quantitative approaches based on inputs and outputs is discussed. The paper concludes that new ‘post-positivist’ models of evaluation are needed to cover all the dimensions of the digital library in the health sector, and some ways of doing this are outlined.

AB  - The Statement of Standards for University Law Library Provision is a comprehensive and flexible set of standards providing authoritative guidance for law schools and law librarians. It represents a broad and authoritative consensus of views. The Standards were originally drawn up by a consultative group established by the Libraries Sub-Committee of the Society of Legal Scholars in 1995 and approved by the Society after consultation with academic, professional and governmental bodies. They have now been comprehensively revised by a working party of the Libraries Sub-Committee, after extensive consultation, and this revision was adopted by the Council of the Society on 9 September 2009. The Standards themselves are expressed briefly and are designed to be of general application to libraries serving an increasingly diverse range of law schools and law school activities. They are applicable to the academic stage of legal education only (undergraduate and postgraduate), delivered through all modes of study, and are supported by a more detailed commentary.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/mde.1422.abs This study is an empirical investigation of the effect of library volunteers on public library demand for paid workers. Unlike previous studies, it estimates the impacts on different types of paid labor. The main purpose is to test whether volunteer labor replaced or complemented paid employees. A translog cost function is used to derive cost shares and elasticities of substitution for Pennsylvania public libraries. Cross-elasticity estimates of substitution and input demand suggest a strong complementary relation between volunteers and professional workers. Most of the other Allen cross elasticities were not statistically significant. None of the estimates indicate that paid labor was being replaced by volunteers.

AB  - ABSTRACT We present synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the full optical spectral range at moderately high resolution [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 2.3 Å]. These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with an empirical stellar spectral library [Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra (MILES)], which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries, which are used to determine the transformations from the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational quantities. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of the MILES stellar library allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old-age regimes and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H]=−2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. We have computed SSP SEDs for a suite of initial mass function shapes and slopes. We provide a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the synthesized SSP SEDs on the (in)complete coverage of the stellar parameter space in the input library that not only shows that our models are of higher quality than those of other works, but also in which range of SSP parameters our models are reliable. The SSP SEDs are a useful tool to perform the analysis of stellar populations in a very flexible manner. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or by using line indices. For the latter, we propose a new line index system to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as a function of wavelength, the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analysed at three different resolutions: 5, 8.4 and 14 Å (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Furthermore, we provide polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system. We provide line index tables in the new system for various popular samples of Galactic globular clusters and galaxies. We apply the models to various stellar clusters and galaxies with high-quality spectra, for which independent studies are available, obtaining excellent results. Finally, we designed a web page from which not only these models and stellar libraries can be downloaded but which also provides a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/jgm.967.abs Random peptide ligands displayed on viral capsids are emerging tools for selection of targeted gene transfer vectors even without prior knowledge of the potential target cell receptor. We have previously introduced adeno-associated viral (AAV)-displayed peptide libraries that ensure encoding of displayed peptides by the packaged AAV genome. A major limitation of these libraries is their contamination with wild-type (wt) AAV. Here we describe a novel and improved library production system that reliably avoids generation of wt AAV by use of a synthetic cap gene. Selection of targeted AAV vectors from wt-containing and the novel wt-free libraries on cell types with different permissivity for wt AAV2 replication suggested the superiority of the wt-free library. However, from both libraries highly specific peptide sequence motifs were selected which improved transduction of cells with moderate or low permissivity for AAV2 replication. Strong reduction of HeLa cell transduction compared to wt AAV2 and only low level transduction of non-target cells by some selected clones showed that not only the efficiency but also the specificity of gene transfer was improved. In conclusion, our study validates and improves the unique potential of virus display libraries for the development of targeted gene transfer vectors. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Our results indicate that (a) the hyperlink network is effectively connected in the sense that each library is reachable from other libraries by clicking a few links and (b) the network has many groups of libraries that cooperate with each other. Most of the cliques consist of prefectural libraries or libraries in the same prefecture. The hyperlink network shows two of the same tendencies as the ILL network: (a) The connection among libraries that are geographically close to each other or in the same administrative unit is strong, and (b) prefectural libraries occupy the central position. There are differences between them, however, in terms of the amount of ILLs and cliques. We conclude that Japanese public libraries have formed a network on the Web that is strongly affected by traditional cooperation, but also incorporates some new types of cooperation from the perspective of cliques.

AB  - Abstract Background:  The Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was formed in 2002 with the merger of two existing trusts. The library services unified to create a new expanded service with 11 staff. Objectives:  The librarians wanted to test out users’ opinions of the service, as a basis for a developmental strategy. They also wanted to find out to what extent they were offering a multi-disciplinary service, available to all staff. Therefore it was decided to include both users and non-users in the survey. Methods:  A twenty-question questionnaire was sent out to a 10% sample of registered users in all staff categories. The same questionnaire was sent out to a 10% sample of non-users, with the help of the Human Resources Department. Results:  The library staff and facilities were generally well regarded. The stock needed expansion in various areas, especially allied health and biomedical science. Non-users were in fact often occasional or remote users. Other non-users needed informing that they were entitled to use the service. Conclusions:  Further research is required, especially concerning the information needs of allied health and scientific staff. There is a need for stock expansion. A marketing strategy is required to capture the interest of potential users.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.4630280609.abs Modern systems theory is applied in constructing a recursive, multivariate causal model for an analysis of intercounty variations of the public library output. In the model, drawing the data on population and libraries from the counties in Florida, selected sociodemographic variables of the community are considered as exogenous variables, while the resource characteristics of the library are designated as intermediate variables which link the exogenous variables to the endogenous variable, per capita circulation. The results of our analysis indicate that four independent variables (educational level, proportion of registered library users, per capita operating cost, and per capita library collection) account for about 74% of the variance in per capita library circulation. Of the four independent variables, educational level exerts the largest effect followed by per capita library collection. Findings suggest several important policy implications to those who allocate library resources to competing libraries.

AB  - Abstract 10.1002/asi.20108.abs In this article, I analyze the role of Donald J. Urquhart in the creation of modern library and information science. Urquhart was one of the chief architects of information science in Britain and founder of the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), which evolved into the present-day British Library Document Supply Centre (BLDSC). In particular, I focus on the part played by Urquhart in the development of that branch of information science termed bibliometrics, the application of mathematical and statistical techniques to information phenomena, pursuing both historical and practical aims. The article is intended not only to trace the history of the probability distributions applicable to library use and other facets of human knowledge but also to demonstrate how these distributions can be used in the evaluation and management of scientific journal collections. For these purposes, the paper is divided into three parts of equal importance. The first part is statistical and establishes the theoretical framework, within which Urquhart's work is considered. It traces the historical development of the applicable probability distributions, discussing their origins on the European continent and how Continental principles became incorporated in the biometric statistics that arose in Britain as a result of the Darwinian revolution. This part analyzes the binomial and Poisson processes, laying out the reasons why the Poisson process is more suitable for modeling information phenomena. In doing so, it describes key distributions arising from these processes as well as the various tests for these distributions, citing the literature that shows how to conduct these tests. Throughout the discussion, the relationship of these distributions to library use and the laws of information science is emphasized. The second part of the article analyzes the pioneering role of Urquhart as a conduit for the entry of these probability distributions into librarianship, converting it into library and information science. He was the first librarian to apply probability to library use, utilizing it not only to establish and manage the scientific journal collections of the NLL but also to evolve his Law of Supralibrary Use. Urquhart's work is portrayed within the context of a general trend to adopt probabilistic methods for analytical purposes, and a major premise of this article is that his law and the probabilistic breakthrough, on which it was based, were most likely in Britain, which was one of the few countries not only to develop but also maintain the necessary scientific preconditions. The third—and concluding section—discusses how Urquhart's Law forces a probabilistic reconceptualization of the functioning of the scientific journal system as well as the law's practical implications for journal sales, collection evaluation and management, resource sharing, and the transition from the paper to the electronic format.

AB  - Abstract Many strands exist within health information work and during the last century librarians in this field identified themselves through special groups or associations. This paper focuses on the key role of the Library Association Medical Section in the professional development of medical librarians in the United Kingdom up to 1978 when it merged with the Library Association Hospital Libraries and Handicapped Readers Group to create the Medical, Health and Welfare Group. Uniting to form a stronger organization, under the ultimate designation of the Health Libraries Group, was part of an evolutionary process. The invention and promotion of co-operative schemes, networking and educational opportunities for members, the publication of specialized material and the fostering of international relationships during the first three-quarters of the century are illuminated by personal reminiscences from some of the major participants in the field.

AB  - Leaf, bark, xylem and root tissues were used to make nine cDNA libraries from non-stressed (control) ‘Royal Gala’ apple trees, and from ‘Royal Gala’ trees exposed to either low temperature (5°C for 24 h) or water deficit (45% of saturated pot mass for 2 weeks). Over 22 600 clones from the nine libraries were subjected to 5′ single-pass sequencing, clustered and annotated using blastx. The number of clusters in the libraries ranged from 170 to 1430. Regarding annotation of the sequences, blastx analysis indicated that within the libraries 65–72% of the clones had a high similarity to known function genes, 6–15% had no functional assignment and 15–26% were completely novel. The expressed sequence tags were combined into three classes (control, low-temperature and water deficit) and the annotated genes in each class were placed into 1 of 10 different functional categories. The percentage of genes falling into each category was then calculated. This analysis indicated a distinct downregulation of genes involved in general metabolism and photosynthesis, while a significant increase in defense/stress-related genes, protein metabolism and energy was observed. In particular, there was a three-fold increase in the number of stress genes observed in the water deficit libraries indicating a major shift in gene expression in response to a chronic stress. The number of stress genes in response to low temperature, although elevated, was much less than the water deficit libraries perhaps reflecting the shorter (24 h) exposure to stress. Genes with greater than five clones in any specific library were identified and, based on the number of clones obtained, the fold increase or decrease in expression in the libraries was calculated and verified by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Genes, of particular note, that code for the following proteins were overexpressed in the low-temperature libraries: dehydrin and metallothionein-like proteins, ubiquitin proteins, a dormancy-associated protein, a plasma membrane intrinsic protein and an RNA-binding protein. Genes that were upregulated in the water deficit libraries fell mainly into the functional categories of stress (heat shock proteins, dehydrins) and photosynthesis. With few exceptions, the overall differences in downregulated genes were nominal compared with differences in upregulated genes. The results of this apple study are similar to other global studies of plant response to stress but offer a more detailed analysis of specific tissue response (bark vs xylem vs leaf vs root) and a comparison between an acute stress (24-h exposure to low temperature) and a chronic stress (2 weeks of water deficit).

The concept of resource sharing, with particular attention to the interlibrary loan and programs for the cooperative acquisition and storage of materials, is examined in relationship to library networks. In particular, attention is given to the question of how these two major components of library cooperation, which have tended to be separate, might become more closely integrated.
