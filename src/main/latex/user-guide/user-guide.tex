\chapter{Configuration}

There are some configuration files you can use to tune ezDL to your needs. 

\begin{description}
\item[Windows] It is located in your home directory as \texttt{ezdl}.
\item[Linux] It is located in your home directory under the name \texttt{.ezdl}. Because of the dot (``.'') at the beginning of the name, the directory is hidden. In Nautilus, press Ctrl-H to show the hidden files and directories before you can change into the directory.
